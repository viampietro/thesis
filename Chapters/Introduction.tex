\section{Safety-critical systems}
\label{sec:safety-crit-systems}

\begin{itemize}
\item present the context of safety-critical systems, examples of
  safety-critical systems
\item present the context of formal methods, program proofs
\item present the fact that it is a hot topic
\item present the context of neuroprotheses and the need for a safe
