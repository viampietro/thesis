\chapter{Implementation of the \hilecop{} high-level models}
\label{chap:hilecop-models}

In this chapter, we present the input formalism of our transformation
function: Synchronously executed Interpreted Time Petri Nets with
priorities (SITPNs). For the main part, the formalization of the SITPN
structure and semantics is the result of a former thesis
\cite{Leroux2014}. However, we contributed to the simplification of
the definition of the SITPN structure and its semantics, and added
complementary definitions for the purpose of the proof of behavior
preservation. Our main contribution to this part lies in the
implementation of the SITPN structure and semantics with the \coq{}
proof assistant. This chapter is structured as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-informal} is a reminder on the principles
underlying the PN formalism and also gives an informal presentation of
SITPNs; Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-defs} lays out the formal definitions
of the SITPN structure and semantics; Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-impl}
deals with the implementation of SITPNs with the \coq{} proof
assistant.
