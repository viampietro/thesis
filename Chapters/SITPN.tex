\chapter{Implementation of the \hilecop{} Petri nets}
\label{chap:hilecop-models}

In this chapter, we present the input formalism of our transformation
function: Synchronously executed Interpreted Time Petri Nets with
priorities (SITPNs). For the main part, the formalization of the SITPN
structure and semantics is the result of two former Ph.D. theses
\cite{Leroux2014,Merzoug2018}. However, we contributed to the
simplification and clarification of both the definition of the SITPN
structure and its semantics. Moreover, we added complementary
definitions that were necessary to express the semantic preservation
theorem about the \hilecop{} model-to-text transformation
(cf. Chapter~\ref{chap:proof}). Our main contribution to this part
lies in the implementation of the SITPN structure and semantics with
the \coq{} proof assistant. This chapter is structured as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-informal} is a reminder on the PN formalism and
also gives an informal presentation of SITPNs;
Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-defs} lays out the formal definitions of the
SITPN structure and semantics; Section~\ref{sec:sitpn-impl} deals with
the implementation of SITPNs with the \coq{} proof assistant.
