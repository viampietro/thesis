\chapter{Proving semantic preservation in \hilecop{}}
\label{chap:proof}

\begin{todobox}
  In this chapter, I want to talk about/draw the attention to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The differentiation of boolean operators and intuitionistic
    logic operators
  \item The correspondence between combinational signal value and
    there assignment expression deduced from the code. Explain that
    this is where the \hvhdl{} semantics plays its part in the proof;
    although we are not detailling how assignment expressions are
    deduced from running the semantics of the \hvhdl{} code. Give some
    examples of correspondence between combinational signal value and
    assignment expressions (in part ``a detailled proof'')
  \item the properties of comp. instances itfaces deduced from the
    transformation (in part ``a detailled proof'')
  \item The particularity of the similarity relation for time
    counters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{todobox}

In this chapter, we present our semantic preservation theorem along
with its proof. The written proof is about a hundred-page long after
compilation of the \LaTeX{} files. Therefore, we will only present
here the ``high-level'' theorems and lemmas used in the proof, and
some hints regarding the proof strategy. The full proof is available
to the reader in Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The theorems
and lemmas presented in this chapter will be refering to the lemmas of
Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The structure of this chapter is
the following one: in Section~\ref{sec:lit-rev-transf}, we present our
review of the literature pertaining to the proof of semantic
preservation theorems for transformation functions; in Section , we
detail our state similarity relation, i.e, the semantic bound between
an SITPN and its \hvhdl{} translation; in Section, we draw out our
semantic preservation theorem; in Section, we detail a particularly
tricky point of the proof related to the computation of fired
transitions, and we show how it has led to a bug detection in
\hilecop{}'s code; in Section, we present some points of the
mechanization of the proof verification with the \coq{} proof
assistant.
