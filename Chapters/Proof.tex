\chapter{Proving semantic preservation in \hilecop{}}
\label{chap:proof}

\begin{todobox}
  In this chapter, I want to talk about/draw the attention to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To ease the reading, place $p$ and PCI $id_p$, meaning that
    $\gamma(p)=id_p$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{todobox}

In this chapter, we present our semantic preservation theorem (or
behavior preservation theorem, both denomination are equivalent) along
with its informal ``paper'' proof. The written proof is about a
hundred-page long after compilation of the \LaTeX{} files. Therefore,
we will only present here the ``high-level'' theorems and lemmas
involved in the demonstration, and some points of our proof
strategy. The full proof is available to the reader in
Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The theorems and lemmas
presented in this chapter will be referring to the lemmas of
Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The structure of this chapter is
as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:lit-rev-transf}, we present our review
of the literature pertaining to the proof of semantic preservation
theorems for transformation functions; in
Section~\ref{sec:state-sim-relation}, we detail our state similarity
relation, i.e. the semantic bond between an SITPN and its \hvhdl{}
translation; in Section~\ref{sec:beh-pres-thm}, we draw out our
behavior preservation theorem; in Section~\ref{sec:detailled-proof},
we detail a particular point of the proof related to the SITPN firing
process, and leverage the opportunity to demonstrate our proof
strategy; also, we show how this point of the proof has led to a bug
detection in the code of the \hvhdl{} transition design; in
Section~\ref{sec:mecha-verif}, we present some points of the
mechanization of the proof with the \coq{} proof assistant.
