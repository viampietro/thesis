\chapter{Proving semantic preservation in \hilecop{}}
\label{chap:proof}

In this chapter, we present our semantic preservation theorem along
with its informal ``paper'' proof. The written proof is about a
hundred-page long. Therefore, we will only present here the
``high-level'' theorems and lemmas involved in the demonstration, and
some points of our proof strategy. The full proof is available to the
reader in Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}.  The structure of this
chapter is as follows: in Section~\ref{sec:lit-rev-transf}, we present
our review of the literature related to the proof of semantic
preservation theorems for transformation functions; in
Section~\ref{sec:state-sim-relation}, we detail our state similarity
relation, i.e. the semantic relation between an SITPN and its \hvhdl{}
translation; in Section~\ref{sec:beh-pres-thm}, we draw out our
behavior preservation theorem; in Section~\ref{sec:detailled-proof},
we detail a particular point of the proof related to the SITPN firing
process, and leverage the opportunity to demonstrate some recurring
points of our proof process; also, we show how this point of the proof
has led to a bug detection in the code of the \hvhdl{} transition
design; in Section~\ref{sec:mecha-verif}, we present some points of
the mechanization of the proof with the \coq{} proof assistant.
