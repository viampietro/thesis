\chapter{Proving semantic preservation in \hilecop{}}
\label{chap:proof}

\begin{todobox}
  In this chapter, I want to talk about/draw the attention to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the properties of comp. instances itfaces deduced from the
    transformation (in part ``a detailled proof'')
  \item To ease the reading, place $p$ and PCI $id_p$, meaning that
    $\gamma(p)=id_p$.
  \item PCI=place component instance, TCI=transition component
    instance.
  \item In the part about the implementation, explain that the lemmas
    about the transformation function are expressed with universal
    binders rather than with existential ones to avoid the multiple
    instantiation of components in the proceeding of a proof.
  \end{itemize}
\end{todobox}

In this chapter, we present our semantic preservation theorem along
with its proof. The written proof is about a hundred-page long after
compilation of the \LaTeX{} files. Therefore, we will only present
here the ``high-level'' theorems and lemmas used in the proof, and
some hints regarding the proof strategy. The full proof is available
to the reader in Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The theorems
and lemmas presented in this chapter will be refering to the lemmas of
Appendix~\ref{app:sem-preserv-proof}. The structure of this chapter is
the following one: in Section~\ref{sec:lit-rev-transf}, we present our
review of the literature pertaining to the proof of semantic
preservation theorems for transformation functions; in Section, we
detail our state similarity relation, i.e, the semantic bond between
an SITPN and its \hvhdl{} translation; in Section, we draw out our
semantic preservation theorem; in Section, we detail a particularly
tricky point of the proof related to the computation of fired
transitions, and we show how it has led to a bug detection in
\hilecop{}'s code; in Section, we present some points of the
mechanization of the proof verification with the \coq{} proof
assistant.
