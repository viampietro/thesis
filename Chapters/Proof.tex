\chapter{Proving semantic preservation in \hilecop{}}
\label{chap:proof}

\begin{todobox}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Change $\sigma_{injr}$ and $\sigma_{injf}$ into $\sigma_i$.
  \item Define the $\mathtt{Inject_{\downarrow}}$ and
    $\mathtt{Inject_{\uparrow}}$ relations.
  \item Keep the $sitpn$ argument in the SITPN full execution
    relation, but remove it from the SITPN execution, cycle and state
    transition relations.
  \item Make a remark on the differentiation of boolean operators and
    intuitionistic logic operators
  \item Explain and illustrate the equivalence relation between SITPN
    and VHDL.
  \item Talk about the correspondence between combinational signal
    value and there assignment expression deduced from the
    code. Explain that this is where the \hvhdl{} semantics plays its
    part in the proof; although we are not detailling how assignment
    expressions are deduced from running the semantics of the \hvhdl{}
    code. Give some examples of correspondence between combinational
    signal value and assignment expressions.
