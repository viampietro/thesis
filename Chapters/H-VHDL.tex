\chapter{\hvhdl{}: a target hardware description language}
\label{chap:hvhdl}

\begin{todobox}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Change the arrow in associations of maps by the coma in abss
    (in rules about elab and sim of gen map, ipm and opm).
  \item Remark about variables that have persistent values in VHDL
    semantics. Not useful as all local variables always receive an
    inital value in the processes of the place and transition designs.
  \item Make a remark on the notation of design states,
    e.g. $\mathcal{E}''$ refers to the set of events of design state
    $\sigma''$ when there is no ambiguity.
  \item Two points of view to consider the semantics of VHDL:
    simulation or synthesis.  Simulation described in the LRM;
    synthesis, problem is that there are no standard, unlike Verilog
    (cite Verilog standard synthesis semantics).
  \item There are different kinds of component instantiaton statement
    but we only refer to design instantiation statment.
  \item Talk about error cases in the implementation part (?)
  \item Change the identifiers between double quotes into identifiers
    in type-writer font.

The main purpose of this chapter is to present the target language of
the \hilecop{} transformation, i.e. the VHDL language. The
formalization and the implementation of the VHDL language syntax and
semantics is mandatory to reason about the programs generated by the
\hilecop{} model-to-text transformation. Thus, we want the reader to
clearly understand the structure and the semantics of language to be
able to fully grab the proof of semantic preservation presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:proof}.  Specifically, we present here the \hvhdl{}
language, a synthesizable subset of the VHDL language. This subset
permits to encode the programs generated by the \hilecop{}
transformation. We devise a formal semantics for \hvhdl{} which is a
simplification of the simulation semantics of the VHDL language. The
formalization of the \hvhdl{} semantics and its implementation is one
contribution of this thesis to the many formalization of the VHDL
language found in the literature. The chapter structure is as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:vhdl-lang-pres}, we give an informal presentation
of the language syntax and semantics. In
Section~\ref{sec:choosing-vhdl}, we present the state of the art
pertaining to the formalization of the VHDL language semantics. In
Section~\ref{sec:abstractSyntax}, \ref{sec:sem-rules},
\ref{sec:elab-rules} and \ref{sec:sim-rules}, we give the full
formalization of the \hvhdl{} language syntax and semantics, a subset
of the VHDL language. Section~\ref{sec:ex-full-sim} illustrates the
formal \hvhdl{} semantics with an example. Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:hvhdl-impl} outlines the implementation of the
\hvhdl{} syntax and semantics with the \coq{} proof assistant.
