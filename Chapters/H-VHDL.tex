\chapter{\hvhdl{}: a target hardware description language}
\label{chap:hvhdl}

The main purpose of this chapter is to present the target language of
the \hilecop{} transformation, i.e. the \vhdl{} language. The
formalization and the implementation of the \vhdl{} language syntax and
semantics is mandatory to reason about the programs generated by the
\hilecop{} model-to-text transformation. Thus, we want the reader to
clearly understand the structure and the semantics of the language to
be able to fully grab the proof of semantic preservation presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:proof}.  Specifically, we present here the \hvhdl{}
language, our own synthesizable subset of the \vhdl{} language. This
subset permits to encode the programs generated by the \hilecop{}
transformation. We devise a formal semantics for \hvhdl{} which is a
simplification of the simulation semantics of the \vhdl{} language. The
formalization of the \hvhdl{} semantics and its implementation is one
contribution of this thesis to the many formalization of the \vhdl{}
language found in the literature. The chapter is structured as
follows.  In Section~\ref{sec:vhdl-lang-pres}, we give an informal
presentation of the \vhdl{} language syntax and semantics. In
Section~\ref{sec:choosing-vhdl}, we present the state of the art
pertaining to the formalization of the \vhdl{} language semantics. In
Section~\ref{sec:abstractSyntax}, \ref{sec:sem-rules},
\ref{sec:elab-rules} and \ref{sec:sim-rules}, we give the full
formalization of the \hvhdl{} language, a subset of the \vhdl{}
language. Section~\ref{sec:ex-full-sim} illustrates the formal
\hvhdl{} semantics with an example. Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:hvhdl-impl} outlines the implementation of the
\hvhdl{} syntax and semantics with the \coq{} proof assistant.

The \hilecop{} transformation generates a \vhdl{} design implementing
an input SITPN model. The transformation generates and connects the
component instances of two previously defined \vhdl{} designs: the
\texttt{place} design, i.e. a \vhdl{} implementation of a SITPN place,
and the \texttt{transition} design, i.e. a \vhdl{} implementation of a
SITPN transition. These designs were defined by the INRIA CAMIN team
at the creation of the \hilecop{} methodology. In the following
sections, we will be using fragments of the definition of the
\texttt{place} and \texttt{transition} designs to illustrate the
content of \vhdl{} programs and the rules of the \vhdl{} language
semantics. The reader will find the source code of the \texttt{place}
and \texttt{transition} designs in concrete and abstract syntax in
Appendices~\ref{app:place-design} and \ref{app:trans-design}.
