The class of SITPNs is a particular class of PNs used to model the
behavior of components in the \hilecop{} high-level models. The
synchronous evolution of SITPNs constitutes the originality of the
model compared to the standard PNs semantics.  In this chapter, we
gave an informal and formal presentation of SITPNs and their execution
semantics. Two previous Ph.D. theses contributed, for the most part,
to the formalization of the SITPN structure and semantics. However, we
helped to simplify the semantics of SITPNs. We passed from 14 rules in
the definition of the SITPN semantics given in \cite{Leroux2014} to 9
rules in our current definition of semantics. Also, we completed some
of the rules when they happened to be insufficient to prove the
theorem of behavior preservation.  Finally, we defined the execution
relations for the SITPN semantics and formalized the well-definition
property for the SITPN structure.

Our other contribution was to implement the SITPN structure and
semantics with the \coq{} proof assistant. There are two
implementations: one with and one without dependent types. For the
version without dependent types, we implemented a SITPN interpret or
token player. We also proved a soundness and completeness theorem
between the interpret and the formalized SITPN semantics. The first
implementation of the SITPNs in \coq{} represents 5000 lines of
specification and 7000 lines of proof. The second implementation
leverages dependent types. This implementation is more concise and
closer to the formal definition given within the set theory. We chose
this implementation to mechanize the proof of the behavior
preservation theorem (see Chapter~\ref{chap:proof}).
