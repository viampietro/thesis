\chapter{Preliminary Notions}
\label{chap:prelim-notions}

In this chapter, we introduce the mathematical formalisms and
notations used throughout this thesis to express and formalize our
ideas. Also, in the last section, we provide the basics to understand
the \coq{} proof assistant, which is the system we use to write our
programs and to mechanize our proofs. This chapter is inspired by the
book \emph{The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: an
  Introduction}\todo{add ref.}, the courses of the Cambridge of formal
semantics, the documentation of the \coq{} proof assistant, and the
\coq{} programming with dependent-types by Adam Chlipala.
