\chapter{Preliminary notions}
\label{chap:prelim-notions}

In this chapter, we introduce the mathematical formalisms and
notations used throughout this thesis to express and formalize our
ideas. Section~\ref{sec:math-formalisms} introduces both classical
first-order logic and set theory which constitute our mathematical
frameworks. Section~\ref{sec:ind-pciples} is a reminder on induction
principles.  In Section~\ref{sec:coq}, we provide the basics to
understand the \coq{} proof assistant, which is the system we use to
write our programs and mechanize our proofs. This chapter is inspired
by the book \emph{The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: an
  Introduction} \cite{Winskel1993} by Glenn Winskel, the courses of
the University of Cambridge on the semantics of programming
languages\footnote{\url{https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2021/Semantics/}}
by Neel Krishnaswami, the documentation of the \coq{} proof
assistant\footnote{\url{https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/index.html}},
and the book \textit{Certified Programming with Dependent Types}
\cite{Chlipala2013} by Adam Chlipala.
