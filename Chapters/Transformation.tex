\chapter{The \hilecop{} model-to-text transformation}
\label{chap:transformation}

\textsc{Research question of the chapter:}\\
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\sc Is there a proper way to express our
    (i.e, \hilecop{}'s) transformation function?}}

\section{Expressing transformation functions}
\label{sec:transf-lit-rev}
\input{Chapters/Transformation/lit-rev}

\section{Informal presentation of the transformation}
\label{sec:informal-transf}


\begin{itemize}
\item High-level presentation of the transformation\\
  \pnote{use the figures of the 2nd CSI}
\item point out the particularities of \hilecop{}'s transformation
  function compared to what have been presented in the lit. review.\\

  \pnote{don't know if the lit. review will give enough material to do
    so}

  \pnote{are there cases of model-to-text transformation close enough
    to our case to enable comparison?}
\item Give an example of transformation in the form of schematic figure.
\end{itemize}

\textsc{Conclusion of the section:} Hard to express our trans. fun. in
a way that facilitate compositional reasoning (if compositional
reasoning is at all possible), partly because component instances are
connected. However, the lit. review pointed out the necessity to keep
a binding between elements of the source models and elements of the
target programs (introduction of the $\gamma$ binder) to enable state
comparison, i.e on which relies the proof of semantic preservation.

\section{The transformation algorithm}
\label{sec:trans-alg}

\bnote{maybe talk about the fact that the transformation algorithm has
  been established by observing the behavior of the current \hilecop{}
  implementation, and through discussions with the \hilecop{} designer
  (a.k.a David Andreu)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the model-to-text transformation algorithm\\
  \pnote{give the alg. as established through our meetings, or maybe
    use a simpler alg. (without the generate infos part, maybe too
    much implementation oriented)}
\item Give the formal specification of the transformation, i.e which
  structural properties between SITPN elements and \hvhdl{} constructs\\
  \rnote{don't know if I'll have the time to do that, but it would be
    great to have it, and use it in the proof. Each time the proof
    says ``by construction'', then the reader can refer to the formal
    spec}
\item Give a concrete example of generated \hvhdl{} code from a simple
  SITPN
\end{itemize}

\section{\coq{} implementation of the \hilecop{} model-to-text transformation}
\label{sec:trans-coq-impl}

\pnote{talk about the state-and-error monad, the $\gamma$ binder, the
  use of generic list functions (fold, map, filter, iter\dots)}

\textsc{Conclusion of the chapter:} Our transformation function is not
really expressible in a compositional way as P and T instances are
bound together. It's a specific case of model-to-text
transformation. However, as much as the comparison with other works of
transformation verification holds, we have been trying to inspire
ourselves from the literature to implement the \hilecop{}
model-to-text transformation function in \coq{}.
